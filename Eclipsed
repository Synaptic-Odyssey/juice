Pitch: A puzzle-platformer where you control a shadow creature that moves only through darkness and manipulates time by swapping between past and present selves.

Key Mechanics:

Shadow Traversal: Move only within connected shadowsâ€”light is lethal.
Time Swap: Switching characters rewinds time for the previous character (maybe the characters are the person and their shadow!), allowing interaction with past movements.
Light Manipulation: Create and reshape shadows by moving objects to open paths.
Gameplay:

Navigate through light-filled environments by strategically jumping between shadows.
Swap between past and present selves to solve puzzles, press switches, and block light.
Avoid being erased by shifting or moving light sources.
Player Engagement (30 min+):

Gradually increasing puzzle complexity.
Tension from light as a constant threat.
Optional time trials and mastery-based challenges.
